Immanuel Baptist Church believes and preaches the gospel of the free and sovereign grace of God in the salvation of sinners, and seeks to gain the widest possible hearing for the truth of the Gospel. We further believe that an expository ministry which expounds the whole counsel of God is the only approach which consistently glorifies God in obedience to the gospel mandate. Finally, we hold that it is the clear mandate of God for the pastoral ministry to labor to bring every member to doctrinal and spiritual maturity for the glory of God.

Immanuel Baptist Church, among many things, is an unaffiliated, fundamental, multi-cultural, non-charismatic, historic Baptist Church located in the southern tip of the San Joaquin Valley.
