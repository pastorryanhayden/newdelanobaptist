I’m currently working on a homiletics curriculum for lay preachers and sunday school teachers. As a part of that, I’ve been going back through some of my favorite books on preaching and rereading them. Today, in Wayne McGill’s 12 Essential Skills for Great Preaching - I was reintroduced to the concept of levels of biblical authority. McGill gives four levels and defines only two - but I thought I would expand on them and give six:

## 1. Direct Biblical Authority

A sermon can be said to have direct biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is the main idea of the text from which it is derived.

## 2. Indirect Biblical Authority

A sermon can be said to have indirect biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is a secondary idea of the text from which it is derived.

## 3. Casual Biblical Authority

A sermon can be said to have a casual biblical authority when the main idea or ideas of the sermon are based loosely on a biblical theme derived from all of scripture.

## 4. Corrupted Biblical Authority

A sermon can be said to have corrupted biblical authority when the main idea of the sermon is based on a misinterpretation of the text from which it is derived.

## 5. Replaced Biblical Authority

When no attempt is made to connect the sermon to the Bible - the authority of the sermon doesn’t come from scripture - but from the personality or position of the speaker.

## 6. Fuzzy Biblical Authority

The sermon has no discernible point and thus cannot be tied to the scripture or even a personality or position.

### Takeaways

I think this helps us to remember several things about our preaching:

* The authority of good preaching is derived from the Bible.
* The further you get from the Bible, the less authoritative your message becomes.
* The further away you get from (#1) direct biblical authority, the more subjective your sermon becomes and the greater your chances of making an anti-biblical point.
* Unfortunately, we hear (and even read in sermon periodicals) way too much 3-6 preaching.
* If we aren’t clear about what our point is, the people who hear us won’t be either and our sermon will have no authority.
