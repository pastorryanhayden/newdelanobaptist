This week, I’ve already written two articles on the topic of standards:

* [Thinking through standards](http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/fundamentalism/2015/11/17/thinking-through-standards.html)
* [Dealing with people whose standards are higher or lower than mine](http://www.pastorryanhayden.com/fundamentalism/2015/11/18/dealing-with-people-who-have-higher-or-lower-standards-than-you.html)

My friend [Jason Wall](https://twitter.com/jasonbwall) had a good point about the title of my last post: The idea of higher and lower (or a sliding scale of left and right) standards really muddies the waters.  I absolutely agree.

Jason even provided a graphic illustration of a lady with “higher standards.”

# Here is what’s wrong with appealing to the left/right/higher/lower trap:

## It misses the point

It doesn’t really matter if standards are “higher” or “lower” or if they are “liberal” or “conservative” or if they are “right” or “left” – all that really matters is “are they biblical?”

Any criticism that uses the scale misses the point.  Truth isn’t on a scale.  It’s true or it’s false.  It’s either biblical or it’s not.  If someone has a standard that goes beyond scripture – it’s not wrong because it’s “too high” it’s wrong because it’s not scriptural.  It’s not what God intended.  If someone fails to live up to God’s standard, they aren’t wrong because they have “low standards” they are wrong because they are throwing out or ignoring scripture.

## It’s a dodge

**Most of the time people go to the standard scales they are trying to avoid a trip back to the standard.**  Rather than dealing with the real issue “is this scriptural” they are trying to shut down the discussion with an insinuated attack.  If they can put the questioner on defense, they can get by without answering the question.  

## It’s a slippery slope

In the minds of a lot of independent Baptist, every inch of ground between their position and full-blown Rick Warren water slide lubricated with baby oil.  When you refuse to examine your standards in the light of scripture because of fear – that doesn’t betray a strong position; it reveals a weak one.  It shows that you have a total lack of confidence in the Word of God and that you aren’t standing on the solid rock of God’s word, you are standing on the wobbling pebble of pride.

## It’s a prison

I really pity those who are trapped in the left/right/higher/lower standards way of thinking because it’s a prison.  No one wants to be the guy with low standards.  No one wants to be the “compromiser.” So this line of thinking inevitably produces a rush to the right irrespective of what the Bible actually teaches.  Well meaning people have a tendency to take God’s laws which are intended for our flourishing and turn them into “heavy burdens that no man can bear.”

We must remember that when Jesus said *“ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free”* He was talking to a group of people who had higher standards than any of us can imagine.  

If the Bible commands something that is “higher” than your current lifestyle – you’ll find freedom in that.  If the Bible teaches something that is “lower” than your current standards – you’ll find freedom in that.  All that is to be found in comparison is a trap and a prison.
