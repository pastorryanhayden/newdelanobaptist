As a pastor, I am constantly aware of the fact that I have the ability to place burdens on people.  When I, through the preaching of the word or through church policy, establish a standard in my church I am reaching into the lives of faithful people and could lead them to do things God never intended for them to do.  So it's my conviction that I have a responsibility to think through every standard and make sure it is biblical.

This isn't a post against standards.  It's not my goal to eradicate "Bible Standards" with this post.  This post attempts to be "standards agnostic."  In other words, if you follow this through it will confirm some standards and repudiate others.  No matter the position you come to, you'll be "ready to give an answer" better for having thought all the way through it and this post is nothing more than a help in that.

What follows are the questions I work through in my mind when we are discussing a Christian  standard.  For the sake of an example, I'm going to use the admittedly ridiculous and little held idea that its wrong for Christian men to grow a beard. (Because it is an easy and relatively non-controversial target and because I recently started wearing a beard.)

# Four  questions to ask about standards:

At a minimum, if you are going to hold to a standard, you should at least be able to think through and articulate these four questions:

## 1.What's the point?

I don't mean that in the way a rebellious teenager might ask it. (Like, "what's the point of these study halls anyway?")  I mean we should ask “if this really comes from God, what are His intentions?"

Two things are abundantly clear in scripture:

First, God's rules are not arbitrary.  Although He has every  right to say “because I said so.” His commands for us are never without reason.

The second thing that God makes plain to us in scripture is that He isn't trying to enslave us or burden us.  His laws are for His glory and our flourishing.  When we follow them He is glorified but it also brings joy into our lives.  By following the will of the Creator of the universe, things work out better for us.

So let's say that I'm considering the notion that God is against facial hair.  Why?  Why would God create men with hair growing out of their chins if He expects us to shave it off every day?  How would that aid human flourishing? How does that reflect the glory of God?

This is basically just asking "why?" and at the very minimum we should have this one down, but we shouldn't stop there...

 

## 2.What’s the source?

This is related to the first question.  Another way of saying this is “where did this standard come from?”

### Scripture

This is the simplest case.  Back to the beard example: is there anything in scripture forbidding men from growing beards?  No. Jesus had a beard.  There is Old Testament law that seems command that Jews had a beard.  At least in the case of beards – the Bible gives us nothing to support forbidding them.

But let's say that it did.  Let's say that there is a verse in Deuteronomy or Leviticus that forbids beards.  Even then it's not open and shut.  Does that particular scripture apply today?  Is it something God intended for another dispensation?  Is it part of the law we are no longer under?  Is it further clarified in the New Testament?

### History

Another possible source of a standard is history.  In our ridiculous beard example it seems that the reason fundamentalists were against beards was a combination of the military standards of the WWII generation and a strong reaction to the hippie movement.  Sometimes, at a particular moment in history, an otherwise harmless behavior is so associated with wickedness that there is a movement to stand against it.

### Culture

Some standards make sense in one cultural context.  For example, in the Middle East where there is a cultural expectation for woman to cover their head, it may make sense to adopt that standard (as it seems Paul did on that context) whereas it makes little sense in an American cultural context.

Standards that are attached to cultural contexts can't be seen as set in stone because culture isn't set in stone.  At some point in our recent history t-shirts were considered underwear.  Today, I’ve been to more than one funeral where a majority of the attendees were wearing t-shirts.  For good or bad, culture changes and with it the definition of appropriate.

## 3.What's the use?

In other words “what possible benefit is to be gained by employing this standard?”

Assuming that the standard in question is not specifically mandated by the scriptures (in which case our discussing should end and our obeying begin) what are we trying to accomplish with this standard?  Are we doing this for protection?  Are we doing this for uniformity? Are we doing this for distinction?  Are we doing this as an attempt to drop an anchor in the storms of cultural change?

In my experience a lot of people who hold certain standards as sacrosanct either can’t answer this very basic question or give very weak and simplistic answers.

It’s important that we are very clear on this.  If we are running a Christian high school, and the reason we have a rule against beards is because we don’t want our high school boys to look sloppy and because half of them can’t grow a beard in the first place – let’s clearly communicate that as the reason.  If we think women should wear skirts to church because we think the visible display of accepting our gender differences honors God – then let’s clearly communicate that.

## 4.What's the cost?

In other words “what are the possible negative repercussions of adopting this standard?”  Here are some of the questions I think we have to ask:

### Can it hijack our emphasis?

I have personally been told by pastors, more than once, that “the emphasis of my church is on standards.”  Regardless of your view of standards, you have to acknowledge that the emphasis of the New Testament isn’t on standards.  Even if you think standards are incredibly important, you have to admit they pale in importance to the importance of Jesus Christ.

### Can it replace the scriptures?

We all know people (good but simple minded) who have essentially replaced their bible with a checklist.  They think of themselves as good Christians because they don’t do such and such and do such and such.  Standards have a sneaky way of becoming our message and just like they make a poor replacement for emphasizing Christ, they make a poor abridgement of the scriptures.  We have to realize that if a standard isn't crystal clear in scripture, every second we spend defending or teaching it is a second we are not teaching and preaching the Word of God.

### Do we want to be known for this?

In our town the biggest church is the Apostolic Center and they are known for how their ladies dress.  I’m not saying there is anything wrong with that, I just think we have to ask ourselves “is this something we want to be known for?”

### Will it be a burden on people?

When Jesus challenged the Pharisees about some of their Sabbath observance rituals, he made it clear that in their zealousness for that law - they had taken something meant to be refreshing and turned it into a burden.  It's entirely possible for us to do the same in other areas.

### Will it have a snowball effect?

I think an over-zealousness for what probably started out as necessary institutional standards (in Christian schools) drove a huge percentage of my generation out of church.  If the "what's the use" is protective, we aren't protecting our kids by inciting them to rebellion.

# Conclusion

I'm not against standards.  Some standards are necessary.  Frankly, there are standards I need to make a bigger deal about in my church.  But I think when we approach standards, like everything else, we should think through them.  Hopefully these questions stir your thinking and help confirm what's right and shed light on what's wrong.
