            Welcome to Immanuel Baptist Church online! We are so excited that you are taking the time to visit our website. Thank you for your interest. On this site, you will find ministry information, our doctrinal stand, answers to frequently asked questions, audio sermons, and much more. I trust that this web site will be a help to you.

            Immanuel Baptist Church has been home for my wife and me for the past 13 years. We have enjoyed the journey of serving the King of kings from this city and from this place. Our Lord has blessed us with wonderful people who have hearts for the work of Christ. I trust that you will not only become acquainted with the ministry, but also come see us in the near future if at all possible.

            Should you have any questions, please feel free to send us a note at enriquecastro777@yahoo.com or call the church offices at (661) 725-0479.

            Please pray for us and for the work that our Lord is accomplishing at Immanuel Baptist. We would love to see you soon! God bless you.

            Your Friend, 
            Enrique Castro, pastor

            Services at Bible Baptist are traditional, but not in a stiff or formal way. There is no dress code for our services, and many people dress in both traditional church attire and more casual clothes. We try to keep the services as simple as possible, singing hymns (both old and new), receiving an offering, and hearing a Bible message. Our services almost always last slightly less than one hour.

            BBC has a lot going on for kids including Sunday School, Children’s Church for two age groups, and Patch the Pirate Clubs  on Thursday nights.  One different thing about our church is that our kids participate in the worship part of the Sunday Morning service and are dismissed to children’s church before the sermon.  **Nursery is provided for every service.**
